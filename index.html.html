The case focuses on the systematic abuse and the use of drugs like date rape drugs. These drugs were used to make the victims unable to fight back. As the trial goes on, the community waits for more news and justice for those who were betrayed.

"The use of these drugs to facilitate the assaults is a profound violation of the victims' autonomy and a betrayal of their trust. This case highlights the urgent need to address the issue of drug-facilitated crime and to ensure the safety and protection of all individuals."

Testimony revealed the alleged rapists were told to:

Avoid talking loudly to prevent drawing attention
Remove their clothes in the kitchen to maintain discretion
Refrain from using perfume or tobacco, which could leave identifying traces
These detailed rules show a high level of predatory behavior and a clear consent violation. The court's look into these criminal protocols has shown how planned the incapacitated assaults were.

When she heard about the abuse her mom went through, she couldn't take it. She had to leave the courtroom in tears. This shows the huge impact on the family and the trauma they face.

The daughter's reaction shows how this case has destroyed the family. As more details come out, the emotional pain for the victims and their families grows. It's a sad reminder of the harm caused by such crimes.

"The daughter's breakdown in court was a heartbreaking moment that underscored the deep emotional scars left by this ordeal. It's a tragic reminder of the collateral damage that can result from these kinds of victim impact cases."
This case highlights the hidden effects of sexual assault on families. It shows how the impact goes far beyond the main victim. As the trial goes on, we must focus on supporting the Pélicot family with resources to deal with their trauma.

Denial of Manipulation by Defendants
Many of the 50 defendants deny the manipulation allegations against them. They say Dominique Pélicot tricked them into joining in the abuse and rape of his wife, Gisèle Pélicot. But Gisèle strongly denies this, saying the men came into her home and followed a set rule. She claims they didn't force her to do anything at gunpoint but instead, they did it willingly.

The defendants are trying to say they weren't fully to blame because of Dominique's manipulation. But Gisèle's strong words question this idea. She points out that the men who took part in the crimes against her are still to blame.

"The men did not rape me with a gun to the head, they raped me in all conscience."
The case is ongoing, and the defendant claims and manipulation allegations will be closely looked at. The court will decide how much the defendants are to blame for their actions.

<b>I</b>n today's fast-paced business environment, startups are finding every possible strategy to emerge and scale. According to an exclusive survey of successful entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, a new crop of groundbreaking strategies is transforming industries and scaling new companies at alarming rates.

<br><strong> AI-Driven Personalization Takes Center Stage</strong>
<p><img src="C:\Users\Davou JR\Downloads\images 9.jfif" width="370"height="270">

Bringing up the rear, at least for now, is using artificial intelligence to hyper-personalize. "We're seeing startups use machine learning algorithms to analyze vast amounts of customer data, creating experiences that weren't conceivable just a few years ago," says Sarah Chen, a prominent Silicon Valley investor.

<br><strong> Blockchain Beyond Cryptocurrency</strong>
<p><img src="C:\Users\Davou JR\Downloads\images 10.jfif" width="370"height="270">

While the blockchain technology has been synonymous with cryptocurrencies, a number of forward-looking startups have started applying it to bring supply chain transparency and develop tamper-proof systems for several industries. "Blockchain is changing how we think about trust in business transactions," says Dr. Rajesh Patel, a blockchain specialist.







 <br><strong>Subscription Economy Boom</strong>
<p><img src="C:\Users\Davou JR\Downloads\images 11.jfif" width="370"height="270">

The subscription model isn't used for streaming services alone anymore. Innovative startups take conventional one-time purchase products to subscription-based offerings. "This shift is creating predictable revenue streams and fostering deeper customer relationships," said Emma Rodriguez, CEO of one very successful SaaS startup.

 <br><strong>Sustainable Solutions Gain Traction</strong>
<p><img src="C:\Users\Davou JR\Downloads\images 12.jfif" width="370"height="270">

But with mounting environmental concern, startups centered on sustainability receive unprecedented support. From green product design to carbon-neutral operation, these ventures seem to be both ethical and profitable.

 <br><strong>Augmented Reality Heightens User Experience</strong>
<p><img src="C:\Users\Davou JR\Downloads\download 6.jfif" width="370"height="270">

Out of the gaming arena, AR technology is breaking into practical business applications. "We're using AR to revolutionize how customers interact with products before purchase," says Alex Kim, founder of a tech-forward e-commerce platform.

As the business ecosystem keeps on changing with every single second, it is basically an innovative set of approaches that have begun to set new standards of success. Those startups now position themselves in the leading edge of their industries and prepared to scale up and go head-to-head with established players in the market.

<b>W</b>ith the face of business changing day by day, the urge to innovate such ideas which break the mold of conventional thinking is what every entrepreneur is looking for. The following are five rather unusual and not-so-common business ideas that could very well become the next big thing:

<br><strong> **Virtual Reality Therapy Clinics**</strong><br>
<img src="C:\Users\Davou JR\Downloads\download (7).jfif" width="370"height="270">
As much as there is increased awareness of mental health, and equally improved technology, VR therapy would also scale. Treatment would then be revolutionized by this kind of treatment. Such clinics could expose patients to in-vivo experiences through immersion to help them neutralize their phobias, anxiety disorders, and PTSD in a controlled and safe environment.

                <h3>Raise stake in Dangote refinery, PENGASSAN tells FG</h3>

                 <b>Dangote Refinery</b>
                <div class="post-meta">Posted on oct 2, 2024 by bizologers </div>
                <p>The Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria has urged the Federal Government to increase its shares in the Dangote Petroleum Refinery from the current seven per cent to at least 45 per cent to enable assurance and energy security.

It said this will ensure further energy assurance and security for the citizens.

PENGASSAN President, Festus Osifo, made the call in Lagos on Tuesday during the presentation of its communique and recommendations from the recent edition of the association’s Energy and Labour Summit.



<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-2562046593597888"
     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>



He explained that the high stake in the refinery would enhance energy security, noting that energy security is cardinal for the survival of any nation and  Nigeria is not an exception, hence the citizens demand energy affordability, accessibility, and availability.

Osifo further mentioned that the government should partner with players in the private sector to maintain the already available petroleum product storage in the six geopolitical zones in the country.

“When operational, petroleum products will be stored there and only made available when there is a shortage in supply. This will help in eliminating the bad roads and severe erosion-imposed perennial shortages that often lead to queues at petrol stations across the country,” he said.

Osifo emphasised the expansion of pipelines that could be used in the delivery of refined petroleum products across the length and breadth of the country to reduce the pressure on roads by trucks carrying these products.

He pointed out that to achieve energy security, energy must be affordable, hence in ensuring affordability, the Government must do all it can to stabilise the exchange rate as the continuous slide of the Naira will greatly hamper the affordability of energy in Nigeria.

In ensuring local production of petroleum products, he urged the federal government to ramp up efforts to make the Nation’s four refineries work.

</p>

     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

He stressed that once operational, the government should divest majority shareholdings and own at most 49 per cent of the shareholding in the four refineries, noting that core investors will be brought in to take the 51 per cent stake.


“Dangote is open to conversations on selling the stake. He was ready to sell 20 per cent earlier and we were also pushing for the government through NNPC to get the 20 per cent, but unfortunately they could only afford seven per cent, “ he said.

Osifo said the devaluation of the naira is the major reason why PMS has become unaffordable for Nigerians, noting no government floats its currency above 100 per cent.

“If, for example, our exchange rate was at N450 to a dollar, PMS would be selling for around N320 or N350 per litre. So, the main issue wasn’t the removal of subsidies. The main issue was that devaluation. The real problem is devaluation,” he stated.

The association called on the government to develop and strengthen the country’s oil and gas value chain to ensure a more efficient and reliable distribution system downstream.

PENGASSAN stressed that without such a system, the country would continue to face recurring fuel shortages as its reliance on a truck-based distribution system is deficient and inadequate to meet the demands of Nigerians given its vulnerability and disruptions due to bad roads, flooding and ad-hoc logistics arrangements.

The association mentioned that the recent trend of divestment by the International Oil Companies necessitated a strategic shift to accommodate local empowerment, innovation and harnessing potential and latent talents, adding that the divestment trend was driven by the combination of global energy transition goals, financial prudence, portfolio rationalization and evolving regulatory environment.

PENGASSAN cautioned that divestments present both risks and opportunities for Nigeria, including a reduction in foreign direct investment, technical expertise and a potential dip in production level.

“A comprehensive divestment framework under the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) to guide asset divestment by Licensees and Lessees in the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Sector should be strictly adhered to and implemented. Pending when the Petroleum Industry Act is amended to include the divestment framework, the current framework promulgated by the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission must be gazetted for full implementation.

“A job protection system should be developed by the government to ensure that Nigerians do not lose their jobs post divestment. An MOU must be signed between the divesting companies and the trade unions to protect members’ jobs and enhance their welfare,” he said.</p>

Business activity in Nigeria fell for the second time in a row as prices rose at the sharpest rates in six months due to inflationary pressure.

The latest monthly Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) by Stanbic IBTC Bank released on Wednesday showed the headline index declined to 49.8 in September from 49.9 in August. Readings above 50.0 signal an improvement in business conditions, while those below show deterioration.

“Business confidence fell in September and was the second lowest on record, only just above the series nadir posted in July,” it said.

This is as inflationary pressures intensified in September, adding to the challenges faced by Nigerian companies as the third quarter drew to a close.
“In fact, September saw an intensification of inflationary pressures, with both input costs and output prices increasing at the sharpest rates in six months.”

“Purchase prices rose rapidly amid currency weakness and higher costs for fuel, logistics, materials and transportation. Some firms made efforts to help their workers with higher living costs, but the rate of wage inflation eased to an 18-month low,” the report said.
As a result of this, the report disclosed that companies continued to report challenging demand conditions, in large part due to the inflation environment.

                <h3>THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN NIGERIA BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT</h3>
                <div class="post-meta">Posted on october 8, 2024 by Godspower Riches</div>
                <p>Nigeria's business landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by the increasing adoption of technology. The country's entrepreneurs and enterprises are leveraging cutting-edge innovations to drive growth, improve efficiency, and enhance competitiveness.

Image:<img src="C:\Users\Davou JR\Downloads\download (17).jfif" width="500"height="300">
According to a recent report by the Nigerian Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), technology has contributed significantly to Nigeria's GDP, accounting for over 10% of the country's economic output.

"Technology has become a game-changer for Nigerian businesses," said NITDA Director-General, Kashifu Inuwa. "It has enabled entrepreneurs to access new markets, improve customer engagement, and increase productivity."


E-commerce platforms, such as Jumia and Konga, have revolutionized the retail sector, providing consumers with unprecedented convenience and choice. Digital payment systems, like Interswitch and Paystack, have simplified transactions, reducing cash-based exchanges.


The Nigerian government has also launched initiatives to support technology adoption, including the National Digital Economy Policy and the Technology Entrepreneurship Program.

"Technology is critical to Nigeria's economic diversification and growth," said Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami. "We will continue to create an enabling environment for innovation and entrepreneurship."


However, challenges persist, including infrastructure deficits, cybersecurity concerns, and digital literacy gaps.


To address these challenges, private sector players, such as Google and Microsoft, are investing in digital skills training and infrastructure development.


As Nigeria continues to navigate the complexities of the digital age, one thing is clear: technology will play an increasingly vital role in shaping the country's business landscape.

                <div class="post-meta">Posted on october 14, 2024 by Bizologer</div>
               <img src="C:\Users\Davou JR\Downloads\images (6).jfif" width="500"height="300">   
<p><b>Lagos, Nigeria- In a bold move to stimulate economic growth and support businesses, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has unveiled plans to reduce interest rates by 2% in the first quarter of 2024. This decision aims to inject liquidity into the economy, encourage borrowing, and boost investment.

CBN Governor, Dr. Olayemi Cardoso, made the announcement during a press conference at the bank's headquarters in Abuja. "The CBN is committed to creating an enabling environment for businesses to thrive. The interest rate reduction will increase access to affordable credit, stimulate economic activity, and create jobs," Dr. Cardoso stated.

<br><h>Background</h>
<img src="C:\Users\Davou JR\Downloads\images (7).jfif" width="500"height="300">
Nigeria's economy has faced significant challenges in recent years, including inflation, currency fluctuations, and slower growth. The COVID-19 pandemic and global economic downturn exacerbated these issues. However, with the country's economic recovery gaining momentum, the CBN's rate cut is timely.

Key Highlights of the Interest Rate Reduction

1. 2% Rate Cut: The Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) will decrease from 13% to 11%, effective January 1, 2024.
2. Private Sector Credit: The CBN will increase its private sector credit target from 50% to 60% of total banking sector credit.
3. SME Support: Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) will benefit from a dedicated fund with single-digit interest rates.
4. Infrastructure Financing: The CBN will provide long-term, low-interest loans for infrastructure projects.

<br><h>Experts' Reactions</h>

<br><h>Economists and business leaders have welcomed the CBN's decision.</h>

"This rate cut is a step in the right direction. It will reduce borrowing costs, increase consumer spending, and stimulate economic growth," said Dr. Biodun Adedipe, a renowned economist.

"The SME support fund will be a game-changer for small businesses. Access to affordable credit will enable them to expand operations and create jobs," added Mrs. Nneka Okeke, Director-General of the Nigerian Association of Small and Medium Enterprises.

<br><h>Impact on Key Sectors</h>

1. Manufacturing: Lower interest rates will reduce production costs, increase competitiveness, and boost exports.
2. Agriculture: Farmers will benefit from single-digit interest rates, increasing food production and reducing imports.
3. Real Estate: The rate cut will make mortgages more affordable, stimulating demand and growth in the sector.
4. Technology: Startups will have access to cheaper funding, driving innovation and entrepreneurship.

<br><h>Challenges Ahead</h>

While the interest rate reduction is a positive move, experts caution that:

1. Inflation: Lower interest rates may fuel inflation, which currently stands at 12.5%.
2. Currency Stability: The CBN must maintain a stable exchange rate to prevent capital flight.
3. Fiscal Discipline: The government must maintain fiscal discipline to avoid crowding out private sector investment.

<br><h>Conclusion</h>

The CBN's decision to reduce interest rates by 2% in Q1 2024 is a strategic move to stimulate economic growth, support businesses, and create jobs. While challenges remain, experts believe this bold step will have a positive impact on Nigeria's economy.
